# ollama skills

Use when editing `src/components/ollama/` (or related imports).

## Do
- Keep changes scoped to this folder's responsibility.
- Prefer reuse from shared charts/grid/layout when possible.
- Update this README key-files list when adding files.

## Do not
- Add route-level pages here — use `src/features/`.
- Introduce new session/API orchestration — use `src/services/`.

## Workflows
1. Implement UI only after service contract is clear.
2. Keep network calls in services.
3. Update README when first component lands.
