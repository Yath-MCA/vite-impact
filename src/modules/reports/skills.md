# reports skills

Use when editing `src/modules/reports/`.

## Do
- Keep screens focused; reuse `src/components` widgets.
- Register overlays via ModuleRegistry when used in editor overlays.
- Update key files in README when adding screens.

## Do not
- Add new primary app routes without `features/reports` migration planning.
- Bypass ModuleManager when the UI is meant as an editor overlay.

## Workflows
1. Add a new report screen file here + registry entry.
2. Reuse components/reports filters/charts/grid.
3. When promoting to feature, move pages and keep shared widgets.
4. Smoke-test each failure report view.
