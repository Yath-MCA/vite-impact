# api skills

Use when editing `src/services/api/`.

## Do
- Keep changes in this folder's responsibility.
- Update this README key-files list when adding important files.
- Prefer feature-MVC placement rules in `docs/FEATURE_MVC_STRUCTURE.md`.

## Do not
- Invent parallel ownership in another tree without documenting status.
- Break stable routes (`/validateurl`, `/editor`, `/login`, `/config-manager`).

## Workflows
1. Add endpoints to API_ENDPOINTS carefully.
2. Prefer makeRequest for standard payloads.
3. Feature-specific payload shaping belongs in domain services (e.g. session).
