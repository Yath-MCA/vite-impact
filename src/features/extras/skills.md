# extras skills

Use when editing `src/features/extras/`.

## Do
- Keep changes in this folder's responsibility.
- Update this README key-files list when adding important files.
- Prefer feature-MVC placement rules in `docs/FEATURE_MVC_STRUCTURE.md`.

## Do not
- Invent parallel ownership in another tree without documenting status.
- Break stable routes (`/validateurl`, `/editor`, `/login`, `/config-manager`).

## Workflows
1. Do not add new screens here.
2. Prefer migrating callers to `features/dashboard`.
3. After import audit, delete or fold leftovers.
4. Document any remaining routed entry (ClientDashboard).
